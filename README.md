# Recommendation System For Double Track Student With AHP

This is an example implementation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) decision-making algorithm to provide recommendations for skill areas that align with the preferences of students who will be participating in the Double Track High School Program.

## What is AHP?
AHP stands for Analytic Hierarchy Process. It is a decision-making framework developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s. AHP is designed to help individuals or groups systematically analyze and prioritize multiple criteria and alternatives when making complex decisions.

The AHP method is based on the principle that decision-making involves comparing different criteria and alternatives and making judgments about their relative importance or preference. It breaks down a decision problem into a hierarchical structure, consisting of a goal, criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives. The goal represents the ultimate objective, while criteria and sub-criteria represent the factors or attributes that contribute to achieving the goal. Alternatives are the available options or choices being evaluated.

## Skill Areas
There are 7 skill areas available for students to choose from. These skill areas include multimedia, electrotechnics, electrical, culinary, beauty care, fashion, and light vehicle/motorcycle arrangement.

## Criteria
There are 6 criteria used to assess the suitability of a skill area with a student's preferences. These criteria include the number of jobs, salary, gender, entrepreneurial opportunity, interest, and skill difficulty.
